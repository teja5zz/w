------
*An online viewer and analysis tool for EnergyPlus Weather (EPW) files.*

EPW files can be downloaded from [epwmap](http://mostapharoudsari.github.io/epwmap) or the [EnergyPlus weather](https://energyplus.net/weather) website.

## How to Interpret the Visualizations
See the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/mdahlhausen/epwvis/wiki) tab for more details on how to interpret weather data for environmental design and building energy modeling.

## How to Contribute
  1. Please suggest visualizations you would like to see and report bugs in the [**Issues**](https://github.com/mdahlhausen/epwvis/issues) tab above.
  2. If you would like to contribute a visualization, code it up, write a section on the wiki on why it is useful and how to interpret it, and then send me a pull request.
